  The worms arrived today.
  I ordered them about a week ago (just before the new year).
  It's now the 5th of January, which means they arrived in plenty of time for my new year's resolution!
  They came from <a href="http://www.bubblehouseworms.com/">Bubble House Worms</a>, complete with instructions on how best to set them up and to make them as comfortable as possible.
</p>

<p>
  There are four buckets.
  One sits at the bottom and has no holes in it.
  That's meant to be to collect the worm tea.
  The others each have holes in the bottom, and the idea is to one-by-one place the buckets on top and encourage the worms to move upwards.
  To begin with, there is the bottom bucket with one bucket on top (the other two are sat to one side).
</p>

<p>
  The worms came in soil in a bag, and we carefully transported them into the top bucket.
  There were some worms left in the bag at the end, so we carefully turned the bag inside out and picked the stragglers and put them to bed.
  Then we let them sit in the light for a few minutes before feeding them an apple.
  Apparently worms have no teeth (which is so cute) and so we chopped the apple up fairly small.
  Hopefully they'll appreciate it!

  I'm genuinely so excited by all of this that I've started naming all of them.
  So far we have Herbert, Bertie, Henry, Rumpelstiltskin, Jeremiah, and Grenadine.
  Unfortunately I can't remember which one is which, given that they move a lot.
  I think it's fairly futile.
  We might come up with just one name to reference all of them.
  I'm leaning more towards Bertie Wormster.

  I'm very excited to be sharing the progress with you all as I start growing my own food in a city!
